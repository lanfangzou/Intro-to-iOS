# Intro-to-iOS
This is my "Intro to iOS" pre-homework app. My name is Lanfang Zou, and my personal email is lanfangzou@hotmail.com. I am a student at Texas A&M University, and my school email is lfzou@tamu.edu. Thanks.

I haven't got my git work, so I just paste the two main code files: SettingsViewController.swift, and ViewController.swift to my github. Sorry about that. I am now working on my git.
